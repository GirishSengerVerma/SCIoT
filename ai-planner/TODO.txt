		Domain File: write by hand
		
		
		Task File: generate from SQL
		
	
		How it works:
			
			For all weather events:
				Based on their type, location and risk level:
				perform actions (e.g. light up a LED, alarm tone, water protection wall, ..)
				
					Based on number of units positioned:
						ALERT_LOCALS_BY_LIGHT
						ALERT_LOCALS_BY_SOUND
						ALERT_LOCALS_BY_DEVICE_NOTIFICATION
						ALERT_AUTHORITIES_BY_DEVICE_NOTIFICATION
						COUNTER_MEASURE_DRIVE_UP_WATER_PROTECTION_WALL
						COUNTER_MEASURE_DRIVE_DOWN_WATER_PROTECTION_WALL
						COUNTER_MEASURE_LOCK_DOWN_LOCATION
						COUNTER_MEASURE_REOPEN_LOCATION
						COUNTER_MEASURE_MOVE_UNITS_REQUEST
						COUNTER_MEASURE_MOVE_UNITS_RESPONSE
			
			
			Based on all current events, re-solve the Units Positioning Planning Problem
				// TODO
			
	
	TODO
		When to disable Alarm Lights, Alarm Sounds, Lockdown, Water Protection Wall again?
		
			just manually?
