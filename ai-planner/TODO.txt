		Domain File: write by hand
		
		
		Task File: generate from SQL
		
	
		How it works:
			
			Detect Weather Events of a certain type at a certain location and assign an initial risk level
				
				Water Level 
					>= 60% < 70%		
						Protection Wall Up
							-> No Risk
						Else
							-> FLOOD 		LOW Risk
					
					>= 70% < 85%:
						Protection Wall Up
							-> FLOOD 		LOW Risk
						Else
							-> FLOOD 		MEDIUM Risk
					
					>= 85% < 95%
						Protection Wall Up
							-> FLOOD 		MEDIUM Risk
						Else
							-> FLOOD 		HIGH Risk
					
					>= 95%
						Protection Wall Up
							-> FLOOD 		HIGH Risk
						Else
							-> FLOOD 		EXTREME Risk					
					
					
				Temperature 
					< 0°C:
							-> COLD			MEDIUM Risk
							
					>= 0°C <= 3°C:
							-> COLD			LOW Risk		
							
					>= 40°C <= 100°C
						Forest 
							Humidity < 30%:
								-> WILF_FIRE 	HIGH Risk
							Else:
								-> WILF_FIRE 	MEDIUM Risk
						Else:
							-> HEAT			MEDIUM Risk
					
					> 100°C
						Forest 
							-> WILD_FIRE 	EXTREME Risk
					
					
				Wind Speed
					>= 12 km/h < 74 km/h
						Pressure < 990 hPa:
							Light Sensor High:
								-> THUNDER_STORM	HIGH Risk
							Else:
								-> STORM			HIGH Risk
					
						Pressure >= 990 hPa <= 1005 hPa:
							Light Sensor High:
								-> THUNDER_STORM	MEDIUM Risk
							Else:
								-> STORM			MEDIUM Risk
								
					> 74 km/h 
						< 1°C :
								-> HAIL_STORM		EXTREME Risk
						else:
							Light Sensor High:
								-> THUNDER_STORM	EXTREME Risk
							Else:
								-> STORM			EXTREME Risk
					
				Vibration
					> 2 Ri. <= 3 Ri.
								-> EARTH_QUAKE	LOW Risk
					> 3 Ri. <= 4 Ri.
								-> EARTH_QUAKE	MEDIUM Risk
					> 4 Ri. <= 5 Ri.
								-> EARTH_QUAKE	HIGH Risk					
					> 5 Ri.
								-> EARTH_QUAKE	EXTREME Risk
				
				CO2
					> 800 ppm <= 1400 ppm
								-> BAD_AIR		MEDIUM Risk
					> 1400 ppm < 30000 ppm
								-> BAD_AIR		HIGH Risk
					>= 30000 ppm
						Inside Buildings:
								-> BAD_AIR		EXTREME Risk
						Else:
								-> WILF_FIRE	EXTREME Risk	

				CO
					Inside Buildings:
						> 10 ppm <= 100 ppm
									-> BAD_AIR		MEDIUM Risk
						> 100 ppm < 200 ppm
									-> BAD_AIR		HIGH Risk
						>= 300 ppm
									-> BAD_AIR		EXTREME Risk
					Else:
						> 100 ppm < 200 ppm
									-> BAD_AIR		LOW Risk
						>= 300 ppm
									-> WILF_FIRE	EXTREME Risk
				
				Combine CO and CO2 Checks so that no Events are registered more than once
			
			For all weather events:
				Based on their type, location and risk level:
				perform actions (e.g. light up a LED, alarm tone, water protection wall, ..)
				
					Based on number of units positioned: PLANNING_DECREASE_RISK_LEVEL
				
					// TODO 
						PLANNING_INCREASE_RISK_LEVEL
						ALERT_LOCALS_BY_LIGHT
						ALERT_LOCALS_BY_SOUND
						ALERT_LOCALS_BY_DEVICE_NOTIFICATION
						ALERT_AUTHORITIES_BY_DEVICE_NOTIFICATION
						COUNTER_MEASURE_DRIVE_UP_WATER_PROTECTION_WALL
						COUNTER_MEASURE_DRIVE_DOWN_WATER_PROTECTION_WALL
						COUNTER_MEASURE_LOCK_DOWN_LOCATION
						COUNTER_MEASURE_REOPEN_LOCATION
						COUNTER_MEASURE_MOVE_UNITS_REQUEST
						COUNTER_MEASURE_MOVE_UNITS_RESPONSE
			
			
			Based on all current events, re-solve the Units Positioning Planning Problem
				// TODO
			
	
	TODO
		When to disable Alarm Lights, Alarm Sounds, Lockdown, Water Protection Wall again?
		
			just manually?
