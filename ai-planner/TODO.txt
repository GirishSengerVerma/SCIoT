		Examples:
			https://github.com/jan-dolejsi/vscode-pddl-samples/
				Airport
			
			https://github.com/SoarGroup/Domains-Planning-Domain-Definition-Language/tree/master/pddl
				taxi.pddl
				taxi1.pddl
				
				
		Domain File: write by hand
			
			Types: 
				Location
				UnitType
				WeatherEventType
				WeatherEventRisk
			
			Actions:
				refillFuelAndEquipment
				
				move
		
		
		Task File: generate from within JavaScript
		
			Reward at Authorities Hub for
					filling fuel & equipment
				
				Even Higher Reward at Locations with Weather Events:
					Higher Weather Event Risk -> Higher Reward
					
					Reward depending on combination of Weather Event Type and Unit Type
				
				Reward for performing adequate actions at Locations with Weather Events
				
	
		
	
		How it works:
			
			For all weather events:
				Based on their type, location and risk level:
				perform actions (e.g. light up a LED, alarm tone, water protection wall, ..)
				
					Based on number of units positioned:
						ALERT_LOCALS_BY_LIGHT
						ALERT_LOCALS_BY_SOUND
						COUNTER_MEASURE_DRIVE_UP_WATER_PROTECTION_WALL
						COUNTER_MEASURE_DRIVE_DOWN_WATER_PROTECTION_WALL
						COUNTER_MEASURE_LOCK_DOWN_LOCATION
						COUNTER_MEASURE_REOPEN_LOCATION
						COUNTER_MEASURE_MOVE_UNITS_REQUEST
						COUNTER_MEASURE_MOVE_UNITS_RESPONSE
			
			
			Based on all current events, re-solve the Units Positioning Planning Problem
				// TODO
			
	
	TODO
		When to disable Alarm Lights, Alarm Sounds, Lockdown, Water Protection Wall again?
		
			just manually?
